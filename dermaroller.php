            dermaroller is a skin care device used to help rejuvenate the skin, treat acne scarring, and reduce signs of aging. But how does dermarolling work? Dermarolling or microneedling is a process that was originally carried out by a dermatologist.
            Nowadays, it is also commonly done at home with little training. It has gained popularity in recent years as an accessible, effective, and relatively non-invasive skin treatment. This article explores how dermarollers work and how to use one.
            It also offers tips for getting the best results. What is a dermaroller? Dermarollers are used to treat a range of skin conditions, including acne. A dermaroller is a skin care device. On one end is a handle and on the other is a roller with
            lots of small, fine needles on its surface. As this 2009 reviewTrusted Source explains, dermarollers were invented through a series of discoveries. Two independent studies in the 1990s explored the use of needles to treat scar tissue. But
            it was not until 2005 that the first studyTrusted Source reported the use of a dermaroller. There are a number of different brands of dermaroller available, and they are considered to be relatively inexpensive. It is important to purchase
            one from a trusted retailer and to make sure that it is sterile before it is used. How it works When the dermaroller is rolled over the skin, the small, fine needles on the roller puncture the skin. The holes that the needles create in the
            skin are tiny and considered to be superficial. For this reason, the treatment is not seen as invasive. When the skin is punctured, this creates a controlled skin injury. It does not cause actual damage to the outer layer of skin. The needles
            help to break down any scar tissue. As this 2016 studyTrusted Source of the technique explains, the controlled injuries to the skin lead to superficial bleeding. This triggers the bodys wound healing response, and the following occurs: the
            skin releases substances that stimulate growth new blood vessels form in the skin the skin starts to make more collagen Over the next 5 days, the collagen produced by the body is deposited in the area of treated skin. This helps the skin to
            become firmer and may reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles. Research has found that skin treated with four microneedling sessions, 1 month apart, could lead to a 400 percentTrusted Source increase in collagen. Uses of a dermaroller While
            dermarollers were originally used by dermatologists, some are now available to buy for home use. Dermarolling was originally used by dermatologists as a way of boosting collagen production for treating facial scars and skin rejuvenation. It
            is now also used as a way to deliver therapeutic drugs and vaccines through the skin. In addition, it has gained popularity as a home treatment to improve the appearance of the skin. Many people use it to try to combat the signs of aging,
            such as: loss of skin firmness appearance of fine lines start of wrinkles Some people also use it to try to reduce pore size or reduce the production of an oil called sebum if their skin is oily. Others try dermarollers to try to improve the
            appearance of stretch marks. How to use one If using a dermaroller at home, a person should follow the steps described here: remove the dermaroller from its container spray it with alcohol solution and wash with warm water to sterilize prepare
            the skin for treatment with an antiseptic or saline wash hold the skin taughtroll over each section, once up and down, once side to side, and once diagonally bathe the skin with saline after the skin has reddened spray the dermaroller with
            alcohol solution and wash with warm water to sterilize leave the dermaroller to dry put back in the storage case When using the dermaroller on the face, a person should treat five sections of the face in turn. These sections are: top right
            of forehead and cheek top left of forehead and cheek right under eye and lower cheek left under eye and lower cheek around the mouth After using the dermaroller, a person can apply serums or moisturizers to their skin. The treatment is often
            used as a delivery system to maximize the effects of these lotions. It is thought that these applications are absorbed much more easily and deeply by skin treated by a dermaroller than untreated skin. People should avoid a dermaroller if they
            have a history of blood-clotting problems, or are using accutane or other medical treatments. Dermarollers should not be used on areas of skin that have eczema, sunburn, or cold sores. Anywhere there are moles, skin inflammation, or rosacea
            should also be avoided. MEDICAL NEWS TODAY NEWSLETTER
