            Mesotherapy for Hair Regrowth Mesotherapy is a treatment which targets the factors responsible for hair growth; and content of vitamins and proteins in the scalp. In this procedure, with the use of dermaroller, mesogun or insulin syringe, multiple microholes
            are created over the scalp and through these microholes, some hair growth stimulating nutrients (anti hair-loss solution, stem cell serum or platelet rich plasma) are injected into the scalp. This process helps to increase the blood supply
            in the full scalp area. It even enhances the metabolism of cell and speeds-up the growth of existing hair follicles and promotes the new hair growth. This treatment has been found to be quite effective in many patients of hair fall or hair
            loss.
