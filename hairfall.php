        Mesotherapy for Hair Alopecia, commonly termed as hair loss or baldness, is the problem of loss of hair from the scalp and the body. It is experienced by people throughout the world. This issue is faced by both genders but the intensity and pattern of
        hair fall is different. Hair Loss results from poor scalp circulation, nutritional imbalances and the excess of a hormone known as DHT. Mesotherapy can be used to correct these problems, stimulating the scalp to naturally grow lost hair with medications
        and vitamins delivered directly under the scalp. Mesotherapy is tailor made for the treatment of hair loss in that most hair loss is caused by conditions existing in the mesoderm, or middle layer of the skin.Success of the treatment is a result
        of sending the right nutrients in the right amount to a specific area â€“ in this case the follicles that support hair growth. Mesotherapy does this by administering the necessary nutrients and anti-inflammatory drugs through shallow injections,
        approximately 1 mm in depth, into the scalp. The material injected stimulates the middle layer of the skin, feeds the hair follicles with a customized solution specific to the needs of the patient. It also stimulates the production of collagen
        and elastin, which are two of the main building blocks of the skin. Increasing levels of collagen and elastin creates a healthy scalp, which can support healthy follicles.
